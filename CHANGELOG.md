    installed and not the Poetry tool.

## v0.11.0 (2020-11-21)

* Added:
  * `bump` option.
* Fixed:
  * `poetry shell` did not clean up after itself.

## v0.10.0 (2020-10-08)

* Added:
  * Support for patching `poetry-core` when used as a standalone build system.

## v0.9.0 (2020-09-27)

* Changed:
  * Dropped support for `pip wheel .` and bumped the minimum Poetry version to
    1.0.2 in order to enable fixing the following issue.
* Fixed:
  * The main project's dynamic version would be applied to path/Git dependencies.
    Now, the plugin tracks state and configuration for each dependency separately
    in order to correctly report their versions.
  * `poetry run` did not always clean up after itself.
  * `poetry.semver.version` could not be imported because it was moved to
    `poetry.core.semver.version` starting in Poetry 1.1.0a1. The plugin can now
    handle either location.

## v0.8.3 (2020-08-07)

## v0.8.1 (2020-05-29)

## v0.3.1 (2019-11-28)

* Fixed [#3](https://github.com/mtkennerly/poetry-dynamic-versioning/issues/3)

  but also any other changes, such as the addition of new dependencies.
